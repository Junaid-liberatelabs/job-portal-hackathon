Hackathon Project Brief – Part 1
(Pre-Hack Requirements)
SDG 8: AI-Powered Youth Employment & Career Roadmap Platform
Context
This document contains the pre-hack (Part 1) requirements for the hackathon project.
Part 2 (onsite challenges and AI requirements) will be revealed on the hackathon day.
Theme & Problem
Many students and unemployed youth struggle to identify relevant job opportunities,
understand their existing skills, and plan their learning journey. Your solution should
support SDG 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full
and productive employment and decent work for all, by helping young people connect
their skills to real opportunities.
High-Level Concept
Build a fullstack web application where users (students, fresh graduates, job seekers)
can create a profile, manage their skills, and discover suitable jobs and learning
resources. In Part 1, you will focus on a clean foundation: authentication, profile, data
models, and basic (non-AI) recommendation logic.
General Technical Guidelines
You can pick any technology/tech-stacks.
● Fullstack web app using any modern stack.
● Persistent database for users, jobs, and learning resources.
● Clean, responsive, and usable UI.
● Deployed or easily runnable locally with clear instructions.
PART 1 – REQUIRED FEATURES (TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE ONSITE)
1. Authentication & User Management
● Implement user registration and login (email/password or similar secure
method).
● Basic validation (e.g., required fields, invalid email format, password length).
● Store at minimum:
○ Full name
○ Email
○ Education level / department
○ Experience level (e.g., Fresher / Junior / Mid)
○ Preferred career track (e.g., Web Development, Data, Design, Marketing,
etc.).
2. User Profile & Skill Input
● Create a Profile page for each user.
● Users must be able to:
○ Add or edit a list of skills (e.g., “JavaScript”, “Communication”, “Graphic
Design”).
○ Add brief experience or project descriptions.
○ Indicate career interests or target roles.
● Additionally:
○ Provide a simple way to paste CV text or notes for later analysis (no
AI/processing is required in Part 1; just store this data).
3. Jobs & Opportunities Database (Seeded Data)
● Create and seed a jobs/opportunities collection or table.
● Each job entry should include at least:
○ Job Title
○ Company/Organization
○ Location or “Remote”
○ Required skills (array/list)
○ Recommended experience level
○ Job type (Internship / Part-time / Full-time / Freelance)
● Include a minimum of 15–20 relevant entries, focused on student and
entry-level roles.
● Build a simple Jobs page with:
○ List view of jobs
○ Basic filter options (e.g., by role/track, location, type)
○ Job details view.
4. Learning Resources / Courses Collection
● Create and seed a learning resources collection or table.
● Each resource should include:
○ Title
○ Platform (e.g., YouTube, Coursera, Udemy, local platforms)
○ URL
○ Related skill(s)
○ Cost indicator (Free / Paid)
● Include at least 15–20 resources mapped to common skills (e.g., HTML, JS, Excel,
communication, design).
● Show these resources on a dedicated page or section.
5. Basic Matching Logic (Non-AI)
● Implement a simple rule-based recommendation feature:
○ Use the user’s selected skills and preferred track.
○ Recommend jobs where there is reasonable skill overlap.
○ Show why a job is recommended (e.g., “Matches: JavaScript, HTML”).
● Similarly, recommend learning resources relevant to the user’s existing or
desired skills.
● - This logic can be simple but must be consistent and transparent.
6. User Dashboard & UI
● Create a dashboard/home view for logged-in users that includes:
○ Quick view of profile and skills.
○ Recommended jobs (from your basic matching).
○ Recommended learning resources.
● Ensure navigation is clear (e.g., Navbar with: Dashboard, Jobs, Resources,
Profile, Logout).
● The design should prioritize clarity, accessibility, and real usability over heavy
visuals.
7. Documentation & Code Quality
● Include a README in your repository with:
○ Project overview (2–3 lines).
○ Tech stack used.
○ Setup steps (how to install dependencies and run frontend/backend).
○ Any environment configuration notes.
○ Seed data usage instructions.
● Code should be organized logically (separate routes/controllers/models where
applicable).
What Teams Must Bring to the Onsite Hackathon
● A working fullstack application implementing all Part 1 requirements.
● Code pushed to a public or shareable repository.
● Ability to run the project on a new machine using the README.
Important Notes
● No advanced AI features are required in Part 1.
● However, design your data structures and flows so that AI and smarter logic
can be integrated in Part 2 without rewriting everything.
● Teams that come with an incomplete Part 1 base will be at a disadvantage
during the onsite hackathon.
